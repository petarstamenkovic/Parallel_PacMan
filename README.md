Parallel PacMan game coded using OpenMp library and OpenCV for image processing. Code is fully commented so for explanation take a look at the cpp file or consult the documentation.
Also i did the project in Microsof Visual Studio so this is easily applicable if you are using it aswell, just import a cpp file in your project. Documentation does not cover OpenCv 
download but it covers the integration of it in a Visual. Also there is a sequential version of code, that does not require OpenMP.
